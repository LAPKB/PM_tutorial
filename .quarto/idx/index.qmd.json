This online book provides\ninstructions and examples to assist users of the `r pmetrics()` R package, by\nthe Laboratory of Applied Pharmacokinetics and Bioinformatics at the\nSaban Research Institute, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, and the\nDepartment of Pediatrics, Keck School of Medicine, University of\nSouthern California. Please see our website at\n[[http://www.lapk.org]{.underline}](http://www.lapk.org) for more\ninformation.\n\n\nYou, the user, assume all responsibility for acting on the results\nobtained from `r pmetrics()`. The Laboratory of Applied Pharmacokinetics and\nBioinformatics (LAPKB), members and consultants to LAPKB, and Children's\nHospital Los Angeles and the University of Southern California and their\nemployees assume no liability whatsoever. Your use of the package\nconstitutes your agreement to this provision.\n\n## Installing Pmetrics\n\n`r pmetrics()` and all required components will run under MacOS (Unix), Windows,\nand Linux. Instructions on obtaining and installing the package are in the README section of our source code [repository in GitHub](https://github.com/LAPKB/Pmetrics_rust/).\n\n## What This Guide Is Not\n\nWe assume that the user has familiarity with population modeling and R,\nand thus this manual is not a tutorial for basic concepts and techniques\nin either domain. We have tried to make the R code simple, regular and\nwell documented. A very good free online resource for learning the\nbasics of R can be found at [Stat Methods](http://www.statmethods.net/index.html). However, there are a number of other free or low-cost online resources which you can find with a simple or AI-assisted web search.\n\nWe recognize that initial use of a new software package can be complex,\nso please feel free to contact us at any time, preferably through the\n`r pmetrics()` [Disussions](https://github.com/LAPKB/Pmetrics/discussions). You can report [issues](https://github.com/LAPKB/Pmetrics/issues) online as well.\n\nThis manual is also not intended to be a theoretical treatise on the\nalgorithms `r pmetrics()` uses. For that, the user is directed to our\n[website](http://www.lapk.org/publications.php).\n\n## Getting Help and Updates\n\nWithin R, you can  use\n`help(\"command\")` or more simply just `?command` in the R console to see detailed help files for any `r pmetrics()` command. Many commands have examples included in this documentation and you can execute the examples with `example(command)`.\n\nYou can also type `PM_manual()` to launch this website from within Pmetrics. \n\n`r pmetrics()` will check for updates automatically every time you load it\nwith `library(Pmetrics)` and you are connected to the internet. \nIf an update is available, it will provide a\nbrief message to inform you. You can then reinstall the package.\n\n## Examples and Exercises\n\nIncluded in this book are numerous code examples and exercises that will help you learn how to use `r pmetrics()` for R. They are designed to be read in sequence.\n\n* Items that are [hyperlinked]() can be selected to cross reference\nwithin this manual or link to external sites.\n\n* `Items` correspond to inline examples of R code, which are not evaluated\nin this document, but serve as templates for what may be typed into your \nR console or script. They may not necessarily be executable if typed verbatim.\n\n* We have designed these pages with the idea that you can copy and paste the code chunks into your own scripts or Quarto documents to see how they work. You can hover over the code chunks to see a copy icon. Click that to copy the code to your clipboard so you can paste it into your own script or document. Alternatively, you can click the **Copy all code** button at the top right of every page to copy all the code chunks on that page to your clipboard.\n\n**Note:** In many cases, we do not evaluate the code chunks because the ouput is too long, so you will need to run them in your own script or document.\n\n```{r}\n# Hover over the code chunk to see the copy icon.\n```\n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r}\n#| label: setup\n#| echo: false\n#| message: false\n#| eval: true\n\npmetrics <- function(){\n    knitr::asis_output(\"[Pmetrics]{style=\\\"color: #841010; font-family: 'Arial', Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 900;\\\"}\")\n}\n```\n\nThank you for your interest in `r pmetrics()`!
